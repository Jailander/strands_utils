ransac_primitives
==============
This is a library for extracting primitives from a PCL point cloud, see `src/test_extraction.cpp` for an example of usage.
The library implements the paper "Efficient Ransac for Point Cloud Shape Detection" by R. Schnabel et al.
There is a package named `primitive_extraction` that acts as a ROS wrapper around this library.
