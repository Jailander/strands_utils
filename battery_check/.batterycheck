Hi,

this is Linda. I YYY during my latest patrol and cannot reach my charging station.
My battery level is XXX %, so I will have to switch off in ZZh hours and ZZm minutes.
Please help me. All you have to do is to come to the robotics lab and put me on the charging station.
Detailed instructions are at https://github.com/strands-project/strands_utils/wiki/Recovery-procedure.
The instructions will be probably displayed on my screen as well.

Thank you,

Linda
